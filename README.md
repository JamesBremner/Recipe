# Recipe
A recipe is a decision flow chart.

A recipe contains:

 -  one source, labelled start, with no inputs and one output.

 - two sinks, labelled success and failed, with any number of inputs and no output

- any number of decision boxes with one input and two outputs, labelled yes and no.

The start, success and failure are connected by a network of design boxes  constructed by the user using a subset of the VASE code.

Here is a simple recipe example with one decision box

The user can opt to run the recipe.

- The decision box on the output from start is highlighted

- A dialog box pops up asking 'Are you ready to start'

- Depending on the user's answer, the next decision box is highlighted and its dialog box pops up

Recipes can be saved, loaded, edited and run.
